    recommendation:
      'Working with Joe was an absolute pleasure. From the beginning, Joe truly "got us"â€”taking the time to understand our goals and what we wanted to convey through each project. Their ability to make everyone feel at ease during onsite recordings was invaluable, especially for our art therapy session. The resulting video, complete with interviews, perfectly captured the essence of our program and its impact on our community. Joe created a stunning walkthrough video for our art exhibition paired with insightful interviews that highlighted the event&apos;s creativity and vision. In addition to delivering high-quality recommendation, they went above and beyond, assisting with uploading the videos to our YouTube channel, designing a professional thumbnail, and ensuring everything was ready for our developer to integrate seamlessly into our website. It was genuinely white-glove service from start to finish. I highly recommend Joe to anyone looking for professional, high-quality video production and a partner who makes the process effortless.',
